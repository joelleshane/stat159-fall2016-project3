\section{Data}

The data for this analysis is from The College Scorecard, a source of reliable nationwide data on over 7,000 institutions. This site, collegescorecard.gov, is a project of the Department of Education to aggregate annual data on higher education institutions. It has information from 19 years assembled from numerous sources. More information on the data can be found at collegescorecard.gov/data. 

The goal of this data was to create a resource for students, parents, and counsellors to be able to access information about the preformance of colleges and universities, and compare which school is the best fit. President Obama announced the New College Scorecard in September of 2015 as a means for people to better find an affordable and reputable institution to prepare themselves to enter the workforce.
