## Introduction 

Statistical Analysis to determine if public spending improves the quality of education.

Models used to estimate effect of spending on education:

1. PCA
2. Hypothesis Tests
3. Lasso
4. Ridge

## PCA
```
Percentage of aided students whose family income is between $0-$30,000
```

## Hypothesis Tests -- Data

Independent Variable : The Amount of Funding a School Recieved 
    
  $$P_f = \frac{\sum_{} (P_i * N_i)}{N_s} $$
  
$P_f$ : Percent of students recieving financial aid 

$P_i$ : Percentage of aided students whose family income is between x-y 

$N_i$ : Number of students in that category

$N_s$ : Total number of students
    

## Hypothesis Testing -- Data

Response Variable : Unemployment Rate

  $$ U = \frac{S_N}{S_N + S_W} $$

$S_N$ : Number of Students Not Working and not enrolled six years after entry 

$S_W$ : Number of Students working and not enrolled six years after entry
