## Introduction 

Statistical Analysis to determine if public spending improves the quality of education.

Models used to estimate effect of spending on education:

1. PCA
2. Hypothesis Tests
3. Lasso
4. Ridge

## PCA
```
Percentage of aided students whose family income is between $0-$30,000
```

## Hypothesis Tests -- Data

Independent Variable : The Amount of Funding a School Recieved 
    
  $$P_f = \frac{\sum_{} (P_i * N_i)}{N_s} $$
  
$P_f$ : Percent of students recieving financial aid 

$P_i$ : Percentage of aided students whose family income is between x-y 

$N_i$ : Number of students in that category

$N_s$ : Total number of students
    

## Hypothesis Testing -- Data

Response Variable : Unemployment Rate

  $$ U = \frac{S_N}{S_N + S_W} $$

$S_N$ : Number of Students Not Working and not enrolled six years after entry 

$S_W$ : Number of Students working and not enrolled six years after entry


## Hypothesis Testing -- Method

Data was split into four groups:
  Schools that recieved relatively low, low-middle, middle-high, and a high amount of funding
  
If the amount of funding recieved by the school has no effect on quality of education rate, we should see little difference in the response variable (unemployment rate), and that difference is solely due to chance.


## Hypothesis Testing -- Method

$$\frac{(u_1 + u_2)}{2} = \frac{(u_3 + u_4)}{2}$$

$u_1$ = mean of unemployment rate for school with low funding

$u_2$ = mean of unemployment rate for school with low-mid funding

$u_3$ = mean of unemployment rate for school with mid-high funding

$u_3$ = mean of unemployment rate for school with high funding

Estimate of Effect of Spending is $y_i = (u_1 + u_2) - (u_3 + u_4)$. The vector of coefficients for this model is $W(u) = (0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5)$.


$$ error = \sigma^2 * \sum{} (\frac{w_i^2}{n_i}) $$

$\sigma^2$ : overall variance

$w_i$ : coefficent for group

$n_i$ : number of observations in the group
